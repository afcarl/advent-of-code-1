Advent of Code
==============

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) - not too much fun to find here, in other words.

## 2017

In progress... far from sure I can find the energy to go through with it this year, though :)

## 2016

I was neither very quick at making the solutions, neither are they very elegant - it's "coding while I'm putting kids to sleep"-quality code. I like to think I learned while making them, or at least I re-learned a lot of things I forgot since studying computer science.

Most of this is Python, so no polyglot challenge, but a few solutions are in C (when I thought performance mattered), one in JavaScript (to be able to use my own [geojson-path-finder](https://adventofcode.com/)) and one in Rust, since why not.

Enjoy, and hopefully join me in Advent of Code 2017!
